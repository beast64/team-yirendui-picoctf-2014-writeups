# Pickle Jar - 30

## Problem

The police station offers free pickles to police officers. However, someone stole the pickles from the pickle jar! You find a [clue](pickle.jar) on a USB drive left at the scene of the crime.

## Hint

What exactly is a [JAR file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_%28file_format%29)?

## Writeup

A JAR file is a zipped file. Unzipping it with your favorite program (I just renamed it to pickle.zip and unzipped it with Windows Explorer), examine all of the files in the zip. One file seems particularly noteworthy: [pickle.p](pickle/pickle.p). Open this .p file with any text editor, ignoring the extension, you find the following text:

    S'YOUSTOLETHEPICKLES'
    p0
    .
