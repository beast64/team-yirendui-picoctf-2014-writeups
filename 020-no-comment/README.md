## Problem

The CD you find has a copy of your father's website: [homepage.html](homepage.html). Maybe something is hidden in the site...

## Hint

You may want to use your browser to view the source of the web page.

## Writeup

In most browsers, find the "View page source" command by right-clicking anywhere on the page or by looking in the context menus.

By inspecting the source, we find `<!-- In case you forget, the password for this site is: flag_c24318194ff14dcf8b6e3a2b8c63d32165df447e -->`
