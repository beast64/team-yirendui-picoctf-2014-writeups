# PicoCTF 2014

So this year I worked alone again. Here's my write-ups.

I realize that some of the flags are randomly generated. In that case I will try to provide the source files attached to the writeup. If this is the case, the flag will be based on the attached files, so even if you have a different one, try again with the attached files.

## Something's Wrong? Missing?

For the harder problems, you could try googling for the writeup if I don't have it. But if you find something wrong with it, then fork [my Github repo](https://github.com/failedxyz/team-yirendui-picoctf-2014-writeups) and make a pull request and I'll try to reply within a day.
