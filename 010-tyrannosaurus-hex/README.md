# Tyrannosaurus Hex - 10

## Problem

The contents of the flash drive appear to be password protected. On the back of the flash drive, you see the hexadecimal number 0x37e43344 scribbled in ink. The password prompt, however, only accepts decimal numbers. What number should you enter? (Press the Hint button for advice on solving the challenge)
